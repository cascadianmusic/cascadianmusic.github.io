## How will I receive my music once purchased?
As a part of the sheet music purchasing process, we ask for a valid email address. Within one hour of the purchase time, you will recieve an email with a download link for the score and parts. If you do not recieve a download link, email us at <contact@cascadianmusic.net> and we will be more than happy to assist you.

## Do you offer physical copies of your music for sale?
At this time, no. By offering our sheet music exclusively in a digital format, we keep our costs down, and pass the savings on to you!

##Does your marching band music come with battery and/or pit percussion parts?
All of our marching band music comes with at least a glockenspiel part, an electric bass part, and either a drum set chart or snare drum, bass drum, and cymbal parts. Some of our music comes with quad/quint tom and tonal bass drum parts as well. Permission to arrange parts for additional instruments (e.g. xylophone, marimba, timpani, electric guitar) is included with the purchase of your sheet music.

## Do you provide custom arrangements?
Possibly. Email us at <contact@cascadianmusic.net> with your request, and we will let you know if it is feasible.

## I would like to use your music for a massed band performance. Does each band have to purchase a copy of the music?
If the massed band performance does not require the individual bands to rehearse the music prior to the event (the music will be distributed at the event), only one copy is necessary. If the individual bands must rehearse the music on their own, we request that a purchase be made for each ensemble, but contact us at <contact@cascadianmusic.net>, and we can likely provide a bulk purchase discount.
