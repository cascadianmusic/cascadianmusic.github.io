This is a modern marching band arrangement of a song known to some as God Save The Queen, and to others as My Country, 'Tis of Thee. The chart features a trombone solo, and can easily be used for concert or pep band as well! Use it as the opener or closer to an English or patriotic field show, or for an occasion that suits performing the United Kingdom's national anthem.

Optional lower parts for Flute, Clarinet 1, and Clarinet 2 are also provided for beginners to use.
